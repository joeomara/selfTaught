This is a python program written to manage certain harware features for a Samsung Series9 ultrabook, specifically NP900X3D.

It started as a frontend for some scripts that were designed to do the same thing. I removed those in favor of a more self-contained program. I wanted an equivalent of the program Samsung shipped with Windows 8, and allow toggling of all controls possible without moving into the BIOS.

Current effort is to make it as generically applicable as I can figure it to be, so anyone with any inclination should be able to adapt it to their system.

Due to fiddling with hardware files under /sys/, it will need root priviledges until I'm aware of a better fashion to do so.
