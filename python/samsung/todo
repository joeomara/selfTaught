implement exception handling, return value checking, and determining if the files found exist or are Nonetype

do euid checking for root permissions, as we're touching on root's files, instead of having a popup appear after trying to execute - see line 17

implement notifications as syscall? && find out if i can package the notify icons from the scripts into this project

determine method of notifying user of requisites for functioning perfectly or bypassing those if possible ( notifications, tkinter )

place in GUI a label or some sort that shows current settings of each hardware device

change background colors if button's device variable is Nonetype

keep sliders from executing their function when instantiated

check a config file in user home somewhere, instead of constantly walking the OS path - assuming the filepaths do not change (some of mine do)

system calls can be made to run appropriate programs instead of writing to files (rfkill for radios, setpci/xbacklight/randrs for monitor backlight, etc) - programs should be installed if made through syscall
