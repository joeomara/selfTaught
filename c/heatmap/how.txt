letters that share with a symbol will need to be added together, so that their heatmap can be stronger and more accurate

once this is done, we can store the hightest heat values as variables, and decide how to map out the heat distributions (probably by length of keys away).

once this is performed we can simply choose a color based on heat value and proximity to hotter or cooler keys
